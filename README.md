### Podoro technique description 

    The Pomodoro Technique is a method to improve the administration of the time dedicated to an activity. It was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980. A timer is used to divide time into indivisible intervals, called pomodoros , of 25 minutes of activity, followed by 5 minutes of rest, with longer pauses every four pomodoros.
